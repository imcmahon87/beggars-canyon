# Beggars Canyon Website

This is the official website of the band Beggars Canyon. Based out of
Portland, Oregon, the band has recently released their second album and
gaining a loyal following of fans. I am honored to design and implement
their website, and hope their listeners enjoy browsing as much as I enjoyed
creating it.

## The Front End

This website was created with React and utilizes CSS transitions for component
entrance/exit animations. The background imagery was taken from artwork on
their first album's cover design. The site is fully responsive to all screen
sizes and devices.

## The Back End

The band is able to update the shows and images displayed on the site by logging
into their admin portal. This utilizes an express server that handles user
authentication, password hashing, a MySQL database, file uploading to the server,
and various GET/POST fetch requests. Everything they modify/upload is updated
seamlessly into the website's user interface automatically.
